## WARNING

```
The code is NOT reviewed and tested by independent parties.  
This means this code is NOT safe.

If you enter your personal recovery words in this application you risk your recovery words to be stolen!  
IF ANYONE HAS YOUR RECOVERY WORDS OR SEED THEY CAN STEAL ALL YOUR IOTAS.

So, how is it possible that someone can steal your recovery words?
Example 1: This code can be manipulated, meaning that everything you type can be send to a hacker.
Example 2: Malicious software (eg keylogger) can be installed on your computer, meaning that everything you type can be send to a hacker.

This tool should only be used if there is NO other way possible to recover your funds from the Ledger device.
Here is such a specific case (very hypothetical):
Let say you put your Ledger in a safe and you have an accident.
You are in a coma and 20 years later you wake up and 1 MIOTA is worth $100000.
The company Ledger does not exist anymore and there are no computers with USB ports.
How can you access your funds with the Ledger device?
Well, you can not. This is a situation where you can use this tool.

Now what if the Ledger device is broken? Can you use this tool to recover your seed?
The answer is: NO!
The recommended way is to buy another Ledger device and than input these recovery words into the Ledger device.
A Ledger device cost $80 and it is better to spend another $80 than the possibility that a hacker can steal all your funds when you use this tool.

SO DO NOT USE THIS TOOL UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR ARE DOING!

This application also generates addresses.  
Do not use these generated addresses to receive funds.  
If you do, these addresses maybe reused for outgoing transactions,  
which means IOTAS on these addresses can be stolen!

Use this tool at your own risk!
